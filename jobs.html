    <h1> Jobs comparison (Web & Game Developers/Designers) </h1>
                
    </br> </br> 
 
    <p1> In our world computing plays huge part for organisations such as companies and schools. 
    There are  many ICT job sectors that are responsible for many aspects of computing world. 
    In this essay, I am going to compare two well-known computing jobs which are web developer and games developer.</p1>

    </br> </br> 

   <p1> The main role of web developer is to design, code and modify websites in terms of creating layout of
    the website and adding specific functions which website contain to meet client’s specifications and allow
    easier navigation on a site.  </p1>
                
    </br> </br> </br> </br>

    </br> </br> </br> </br>
    
    <p1> On the other hand, the other ICT job that I am going to look at is game developer which is a person who is
    simply responsible for creating video games. Their main role is to make sure what the concept of the game is, 
    story behind the game in terms coding and programming. </p1>
  
    </br> </br> </br> </br>

    <img class="topicimage" src="images\game-developer.jpg" alt="Game Developer">

    </br> </br> </br> </br>   

    <p1> For web developer, the skills required are mostly strong knowledge of HTML and CSS and also PHP and JavaScript 
    to understand how both HTML and CSS have been used to create website and be able to produce website for big 
    organisations to earn money. One of the most important skills that a person who would like to become web developer
    should have is the ability to build website and applications from scratch. </p1>
    
    </br> </br>

    <p1> Moreover, the main skills that game developer/programmer needs to have is creativity and imagination.
    It is vital to produce a good story behind the game and give plenty of functions that will enable the person 
    who plays the game to have different pathways to complete the game. </p1>

    <h1> Similiarities and Differences of both Web & Game Developer/Designer </h1>
            
    </br> </br>

    <p1> In terms of requirements for both job roles that people would be interested to apply for, there are few certain 
    criteria that need to be met to become either web or games developer. </p1>

    </br> </br>

    <p1> Likewise, both web and game developer job roles have similar skills that need to be used to obtain those job roles. </p1>

    </br> </br>

    <p1> Firstly, both developers must be able to solve problems during creation of game or website. This is because the 
    final product can not have any errors or features that are not working as clients may not going to use that product. </p1>
            
    </br> </br>

    <p1> Secondly, in both job roles there is a requirement to be creative and use imagination to turn 
    ideas obtained from clients into the final project. </p1>
    
    </br> </br>

    <p1> Another skill that is required for both web and game developer to have is the ability to work under pressure 
    and meet set deadlines. Similarly, for previously said job roles, there is a skill that people who would like to 
    become web or game developer need to have and that is passion for design. This means that person chooses best 
    colours, functions and concept of their project that will be suitable for their clients needs. </p1>
            
    </br> </br>
            
    <p1> Regarding previously mentioned job roles, there is one last aspect that I am going to compare web and game 
    developer which is a salary. For a starting web developer, the average salary that person will earn is roughly 
    from £20,000 to £24,000 whereas for a starting game developer or designer the salary is slightly different as it 
    starts from £19,000 to £25,000. For an experienced web developer, the salary increases in the range from £25,000 
    to £35,000 in contrast to an experienced game developer/designer the range is £30,000 to £50,000. 
    Equivalently, the starting salary for highly experience web or game developers is £50,000 but for game developers 
    the range is up to £70,000 where as for web developer could be even higher. </p1>
