    <h2> Models of Good Practice in User Interface </h2>

    </br> </br>
                
    <p1> For this part of the project, I have been working with Roland and Dima to make research of choosing good models of other websites that could be influential for final designs of our individual websites. We have been search for a large amount of web pages with different designs and functions included inside them. We have done this because we wanted to make sure that our design would be suitable for us and users who would potential visit our website. </p1> 
        
    </br> </br>

    <p1> Another thing is that that we wanted to make our website professional in the way that we could present modern design website. However, I have found few websites that were quite inspirational to me in terms of design and simple design which I could implement to my website that would be easier to understand to navigate around. Final design of my website does look quite identical the other well-known websites in terms of structure of the page with the similar placement of header, navigation bar and footer. However, the content on my website is different as I written the content with my own words and topic that I have mentioned in website is more like a review web development and general information about my university course and module.  </p1>
