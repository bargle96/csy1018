    </br> </br> 

    <p1> Web development is a course which I will concentrate on in this section of the website. 
    During progression of this course, I have learnt a wide range of different techniques and creation 
    of elements that I would use for my assignment which is the creation of a website that contains six pages.
    However, previously learnt techniques would also help me in the future when I decide to study web development
    module at further stages of my studies. </p1>

    </br> </br>
    
    <p1> So far, during the first term of studying web development, I have learnt what code editors to use and basics
    of HTML and CSS which gave me knowledge that I will use for my first assignment which is creating a website. 
    This means that I have learnt what is the best editor to use and which code section applies to creation
    of the object on web page and what section is responsible for visual aspects meaning that certain object
    is displayed on web page that you are working on. </p1>

    </br> </br>

    <p1>The code editors that I have used during first term of this module were Visual Studio Code and web-based code editor
    called Thimble. Another thing that I have learnt is to build a simple layout of the website and basic navigation bar that
    could be used by beginners to create website. Next thing that I have learnt during first term of web development module is 
    to work with images in terms of adding them to web pages and optimising images to display them in higher resolution and modifying 
    colours that will be in contrast with the colours used on website. Finally, I have also learnt how to add videos, animations
    and any sort of interactivity to web pages that user will use while they are navigating on the website. </p1>

    </br> </br>
                
    <p1> Through previously learnt techniques in web development, I hope that I will successfully finish my assignment by creating
    website on good standards. I also hope that all gained skills will help me to develop my skills that I may need in future. </p1>
